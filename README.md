The visual impact of seeing your life laid out in this format can be transformative:
- **Urgency**: Realizing how finite our time really is
- **Clarity**: Understanding what truly matters
- **Motivation**: Inspiring action rather than procrastination
- **Perspective**: Putting daily problems in context

## Customization

The application is designed to be easily customizable:

### Adding New Themes
Add new style classes in `styles.css` and corresponding buttons in the HTML.

### Modifying Life Expectancy Options
Update the select options in `index.html` and the corresponding JavaScript handling.

### Changing Motivational Messages
Edit the `messages` object in the `updateMotivationalMessage` method in `script.js`.

- **Stoic Philosophy**: Memento mori and awareness of mortality as motivation
- **Islamic Time Management**: "Take advantage of five before five" hadith
